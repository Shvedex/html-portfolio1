<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Seth. I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer,<br />
  passionate about solving all kinds ob web-related problems.<br />
  I'm especially interested in helping individuals and small<br />
  businesses turn their dreams of creating or building a<br />
  successful online presence a reality.</p>

<p>Welcome to my personal portfolio where I showcase some of my <br />
  best online projects. Please be sure to contact me if you have any<br />
  questions or are inspired by what you see and are interested in<br />
  collaborating with me!</p>

<p>When I'm not saving the world coding and catching up on all the<br />
  latest developments in tech, I enjoy spending my time out in nature<br />
  or dancing, but you'll often find me just chilling at home reading<br />
  or watching my favorite TV-show with my two lovely cats. I'll never<br />
  say no to a game of MTG Commander!</p>
