    you might want to watch<br />
     before you turn thirty</h1> 
(I just thought of them rn)
<h3>Here are a few of my favorite movies<br /> that appeared to have stayed with me. <br />I believe every young adult would benefit <br />from watching these.</h3>
<hr />

<h3>1. No Country for Old Men</h3>
<p>This chilling portrayal of a ruthless <br />mass murderer will make you question <br />how and who you trust in the "real" world.</p>

<h3>2. Spirited Away</h3>
<p>In contrast, this animated masterpiece will <br />take you on a ride of childlike adventure and wonder,<br />reminding us to nurture the child within us.</p>


<h3>3. Into the Wild</h3>
<p>Nowadays, we tend to be increasingly <br />disconnected to our natural surroundings. <br />
This film encouraged me to seek a simple life and <br />reconnect to what really matters while pursuing my <br />dreams and freedom.</p>

<h3>4. The Departed</h3>
<p>One of my favorite crime films of all time, <br />the comprehensive quality of this masterpiece and <br />its storytelling will have you on the edge of your seat. <br />Also, I love Leonardo.</p>

<h3>5. The Hunt</h3>
<p>This list wouldn't be complete without <br />a European director and one of my <br />favorite European actors. One of the most gripping and <br />unbelievably believable dramas you'll ever watch.</p>
